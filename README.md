# JamSpell JNI Binding
A JNI binding for [JamSpell](https://github.com/bakwc/JamSpell) (a modern spellchecking library), generated with [Swig](http://www.swig.org/).
This project contains both the Java JNI API and the native C/C++ JNI implementation, as generated by Swig, with no additional files.

As such, this is a bare-bones library that simply aims to represent the native JamSpell in the Java world, allowing other libraries with better
usability to be easily built on top of it by simply looking at how the C++ project works.

## Generating & Building
Use the included `jamspell-jni.i` swig interface file to generate the appropriate .cpp and .java files. A PowerShell script containing the appropriate commands
can be found at the root of the repository (`generate.ps1`).

The Native C/C++ project is located under the `cpp` directory, and is built with cmake. It is linked statically to jamspell to produce a single shared library
with both JamSpell and its JNI binding. 
For Windows users building with Visual Studio 2017, a PowerShell script can found at `cpp/build-vs2017.ps1` to aid in building the project.

The Java JNI interface is located under the `java` directory, and is built with gradle. Its version must be exactly equal to the JamSpell version with which it was
generated.
